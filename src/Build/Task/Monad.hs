-- | Given a task description @task@, a target @key@, an initial @store@, and a
-- @result@ produced by running a build system with parameters @task@, @key@ and
-- @store@, this function returns 'True' if @result@ is a correct build outcome.
-- Specifically:
-- * @result@ and @store@ must agree on the values of all inputs. In other words,
--   no inputs were corrupted during the build.
-- * @result@ is /consistent/ with the @task@, i.e. for all non-input keys, the
--   result of recomputing the @task@ matches the value stored in the @result@.

-- | Convert a task with a total lookup function @k -> m v@ into a task

-- essentially lifts the task from the type of values @v@ to @Either e v@,
-- where the result @Left e@ indicates that the task failed because of a
-- failed dependency lookup, and @Right v@ yeilds the value otherwise.
