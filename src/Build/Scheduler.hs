-- value, but in future this may be optimised, e.g. by comparing their hashes.

-- | A model of the scheduler used by Bazel. We extract a key K from the queue
-- and try to build it. There are now two cases:
-- 1. The build fails because one of the dependencies of K is dirty. In this
--    case we add the dirty dependency to the queue, listing K as blocked by it.
-- 2. The build succeeds, in which case we add all keys that were previously
--    blocked by K to the queue.
