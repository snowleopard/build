-- | Given a description of @tasks@, an initial @store@, and a @result@ produced
-- by running a build system on a target @key@, this function returns 'True' if
-- the @result@ is a correct build outcome. Specifically:
-- * @result@ and @store@ must agree on the values of all inputs. In other words,
--   no inputs were corrupted during the build.
-- * @result@ is /consistent/ with the @tasks@, i.e. for every non-input key,
--   the result of recomputing its task matches the value stored in the @result@.
